1,What is the role of a prototype program in problem solving?,To simulate the behaviour of portions of the desired software product.
2,What stages in the software life cycle are influenced by the testing stage?,The testing stage can influence both the coding stage (phase 5) and the solution refinement stage (phase 7)

4,Where do C++ programs begin to execute?,At the main function.
5,What is a variable?,A location in memory that can store a value.
6,Where are variables declared in a C++ program?,Variables can be declared anywhere in a program. They can be declared inside a function (local variables) or outside the functions (global variables)
7,What is the main difference between a while and a do...while statement?,The block inside a do...while statement will execute at least once.
8,What is typically included in a class definition?,Data members (attributes) and member functions.
9,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,Data members can be accessed from any member functions inside the class defintion. Local variables can only be accessed inside the member function that defines them.
10,What is the difference between a constructor and a function?,"A constructor is called whenever an object is created, whereas a function needs to be called explicitely. Constructors do not have return type, but functions have to indicate a return type."

13,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,"A function prototype includes the function signature, i.e., the name of the function, the return type, and the parameters' type. The function definition includes the actual body of the function."

18,What is the main advantage associated with function arguments that are passed by reference?,It avoids making copies of large data structures when calling functions.
19,How are overloaded functions differentiated by the compiler?,"Based on the function signature. When an overloaded function is called, the compiler will find the function whose signature is closest to the given function call."
20,"When defining a recursive function, what are possible causes for infinite recursion?","If the recursion step is defined incorrectly, or if the base case is not included."
21,What are the similarities between iteration and recursion?,They both involve repetition; they both have termination tests; they can both occur infinitely.
22,What are the two different ways of specifying the length of an array?,"In the array declaration, or by using an initializer list."
23,What is the main difference between strings declared using the type string versus strings declared using an array of characters?,The strings declared using an array of characters have a null element added at the end of the array.
24,How are arrays passed to functions?,by reference.
25,"What is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?","The arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program; that is, they are initialized only once, when the function that declares the array it is first called."

30,What is the base case for a recursive implementation of merge sort?,When the size of the array to be sorted is 1 (or 2)

32,What does the address (&) operator return?,The memory address of its operand.
33,What does the star (*) operator return?,An alias (synonym) for the name of the object that its operand points to in memory. It is the dereferencing operator.
34,How can an array be addressed in pointer/offset notation?,"By initializing a pointer to point to the first element of the array, and then incrementing this pointer with the index of the array element."
35,What does the sizeof operator return?,The size in bytes of its operand.
36,What are the different ways to pass a pointer to a function?,"There are four ways: nonconstant pointer to constant data, nonconstant pointer to nonconstant data, constant pointer to constant data, constant pointer to nonconstant data."
37,What is a function pointer?,The address of the location in memory where the function code resides.

39,What is the main advantage of linked lists over arrays?,The linked lists can be of variable length.
40,What is the main advantage of arrays over linked lists?,"The elements in an array can be accessed directly (as opposed to linked lists, which require iterative traversal)."
41,How are linked lists passed as arguments to a function?,By reference.
42,What is the difference between a circular linked list and a basic linked list?,The last element in a circular linked list points to the head of the list.
43,What is the main advantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?,"All the deletion and insertion operations can be performed in constant time, including those operations performed before a given location in the list or at the end of the list."
44,What is the main disadvantage of a doubly-linked list over a basic linked list?,Extra space required to store the back pointers.
45,What is a stack?,"A data structure that can store elements, which has the property that the last item added will be the first to be removed (or last-in-first-out)"
46,What are the two main functions defined by a stack?,push and pop
47,How can you implement a stack with an array?,"Keep the top of the stack toward the end of the array, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements from the right side of the array."
48,How can you implement a stack with a list?,"Keep the top of the stack pointing to the head of the linked list, so the push and pop operations will add or remove elements at the beginning of the list."
49,How are infix expressions evaluated by computers?,"First, they are converted into postfix form, followed by an evaluation of the postfix expression."
50,What operations would you need to perform to find a given element on a stack?,"Pop all the elements and store them on another stack until the element is found, then push back all the elements on the original stack."
